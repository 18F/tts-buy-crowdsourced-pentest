## Background

GSA TTS is designing and developing a Shared Authentication Platform to answer and meet recent federal directives and action plans released by the Executive Office of the President to provide citizens with secure singular digital accounts that can be used government-wide to access participating federal agencies. Congress saw the need for citizens to securely access federal agencies and passed the Cybersecurity Act (CISA) in October 2015 to strengthen the Nationâ€™s Cybersecurity. The Executive Office of the President defined actions federal agencies can follow to meet CISA in the Cybersecurity National Action Plan in February 2016.

Armed with knowledge gained from an initial operational capability utilizing third-party credentials and with valuable Government, industry, and customer input, GSA TTS will operationalize a shared authentication platform titled [Login.gov](https://login.gov/) that provides citizens with government-provided digital identities established at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Level of Assurance LOA1 and LOA3 in 800-63-2 with remote proofing, in a simple, elegant manner from a technical environment that is built on experiences, processes, and infrastructure that will use the latest available technology to safeguard all user data.
